# OCR-Neural-Network
### Project Description
This project is the implementation of the most basic "hello world" neural network written from scratch. The task is to recognize hand written digits provided as a 28 by 28 pixel image. The goal of the project was to understand all about the most fundamental concepts in machine learning such as gradient descent, loss function, feedforward and backpropagation, implemented in the NeuralNetwork class.
